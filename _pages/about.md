I have previously worked for a large internet company and participated in a mobile internet startup. After that, I pursued an integrated Master's-Doctorate Program at Fudan University and now work at Hainan University with solid theoretical and engineering practical capabilities. I welcome students, who are self-driven and interested in IT industry, to contact me. You can learn what you desire from me! My current research interests include blockchain, applied cryptography, privacy computation and deep learning.
